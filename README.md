The site is running through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Running it locally

1. Install Jekyll. *([Just follow the steps in this tutorial.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#installing-jekyll))*
2. Run `jekyll serve` and it'll fire up a server and watch for changes. *(It doesn't auto refresh though. So keep your finger on the F5)*
3. There's no JavaScript for the main site and all CSS is being compiled by `Jekyll`. *(So no need for a fancy automated build system like `gulp`)*

		Hey there! I’m Rick van Mook, a front-end developer from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Raamsdonksveer,+Netherlands" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a>. I like to play around with JavaScript and
		love to create things from scratch. The intention of this blog will be a documentation of me reinventing wheels and
		learning things along the way.
	</p>

	<p class="about__sub">
		If you’re curious about my experience check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvmook" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile and if you’re really into me you can
		even check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rickvanmook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. I’m also on <a href="https://twitter.com/rvmook" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I talk less about programming there so expect tweets about video
		games, cartoons and all that good stuff.

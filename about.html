	<p>
		Hey there! I’m Rick van Mook, a front-end developer from The Netherlands. I like to play around with JavaScript and
		love to create things from scratch. The intention of this blog will be a documentation of me reinventing wheels and
		learning things along the way.

		If you’re curious about my experience check out my work, my LinkedIn profile and if you’re really into me you can
		even check out my Facebook. I’m also on Twitter, I talk less about programming there so expect tweets about video
		games, cartoons and all that good stuff.

		Hey there! Iâ€™m Rick van Mook, a creative developer from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Raamsdonksveer,+Netherlands" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a>.
		I started my career as a Flash developer at <a href="http://momkai.com" target="_blank">Momkai in Amsterdam</a>. After three years,
		I switched my focus to JavaScript and, in 2013, joined <a href="http://firstborn.com" target="_blank">Firstborn in New York</a>.
	</p>

	<p class="about__sub">
		I like to play around with JavaScript and love to create things from scratch. The intention of this blog will be
		a documentation of me reinventing wheels and learning things along the way. If you're curious about my work
		experience check out the <a href="/work/">work page</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvmook" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile.
		For those of you who want to have a peek into my personal life, you can follow me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rickvanmook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,
		or <a href="https://twitter.com/rvmook" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

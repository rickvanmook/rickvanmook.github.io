About the Project
-----------------
To promote the 2010 World Cup from a Dutch perspective, five young Dutch artists created an art piece to portrait their love for football and the Dutch team. The website served as a platform to showcase their work.

What I Did
----------
As Supporting Flash Developer I was responsible for the background transitions and some small UI components.

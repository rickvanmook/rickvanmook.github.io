description: <p>The Make Your Money Matter movement highlights the positive social impact that credit unions make. We developed an animated scrolling experience that follows the journey of a typical deposit through big banks versus credit unions.</p>
work: <p>As Lead Developer for this website I was responsible for developing the custom scrolling animation framework for tablet and desktop browsers. With it, I was able to quickly animate and fine-tune all the different scenes of the project.</p>

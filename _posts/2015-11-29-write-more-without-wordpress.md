A while ago I made the decision to start my own personal blog. I was planning to write all these cool web development articles. But it's been over a year since I actually wrote anything.

Unfortunately, it turned out I didn't feel I had that much to write about. Sure, I made some cool projects. I just didn't feel they were interesting enough to write about. At least, that's how I felt when I worked on them.

I want to break that cycle. There's a bunch of side projects in the pipeline and it will be fun to have a place to keep people up to date. I got rid of WordPress and I'm now using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for this site. It's free and it makes it way easier for me to write small updates.

Starting next week, I'll be writing little updates for the projects I'm working on. So, I hope you'll check back soon and I promise there will be more items in here!

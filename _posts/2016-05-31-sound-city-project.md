About the Project
-----------------
Using an innovative combination of panoramic photography and 3D sound, the Sound City Project gives users the feeling of what it’s like to travel the world—all from the comfort of their desktop.

We built a custom “soundhead,” complete with four 3D printed ears, that allows us to capture sound in every direction. Using Web Audio, we then stitch the tracks together for seamless playback.

What I Did:
-----------
I was responsible for all web related development. Including a 3D audio engine with complex WebAudio manipulation, a custom Google Maps implementation plus all HTML, CSS and interface animations.

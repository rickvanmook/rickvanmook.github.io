About the Project
-----------------
This is my submission for the 2014 JS1K competition. It's a code golfing competition where you have to create a demo within 1024 bytes of JavaScript.

What I Did
----------
Instead of using a minifier I thought it would be more fun to minify the code by hand. I ended up writing a little 'game-engine' that supports:

- Walking, jumping and swimming animation
- Hit detection
- Endless scrolling world
- Expending sea when resizing the browser
